Solitary gravity wave
=====================

These Matlab scripts compute the steady irrotational surface solitary gravity wave solution of the Euler equations (homogeneous, incompressible and perfect fluids). The wave is defined by its Froude number *Fr* and the result is about fifteen digits accurate. The method works for all but the highest waves, *i.e.* for all amplitude/depth ratio less than 0.796.
